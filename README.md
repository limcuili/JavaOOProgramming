Please keep in mind that this is NOT how you should test your Java programs. Consider using JUnit for testing.
The reason I the testing the way I did is because it is expected of my course at university. In particular, I was meant to have my tests as a main method within the "API"s.
I separated the tests and the classes to keep things readable and to hold onto the TDD principles I was taught.
